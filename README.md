# Pedagogical Shiny App for an Undergraduate Course in Political Science

This Shiny app has been created as a pedagogical tool for undergraduate students in a political science course at the University of Montreal (Fall 2020). Students in the class ran a survey on electoral behaviour, collecting responses from several hundred respondents. TAs then created a dataset with the survey responses. I was responsible for coding the Shiny app in RStudio in order to provide students with tools to calculate descriptive and inferential statistics on these data. The Shiny app includes panels with widgets to create data tables and run OLS regressions.
